	<h1 id="about-us">Welcome To Debugging University of Software Development</h1>

	<p> Debugging University of Technology,is a private University established by the Bells Educational Foundation. It was granted an operational license by the Federal Government on 9 June, 2005. The formal take off of the Foundation to contribute to university education delivery in Nigeria, haven successfully established and run Bells Comprehensive Secondary School for years. The Foundation had dreamt of a University that was unique in both its philosophy and curriculum.</p>

  <p> Accordingly, DebugTech University of Technology  (DebugTech)  is intended to be locally and internationally unique in its programme focus, the curricula are designed to ensure that its graduates are computer literate and that staff and students are linked with industries to support economic and enterprise development, as well as technology transfer.</p>

  <p> DebugTech University of Technology, Nigeria's foremost private University of Technology, is dedicated to quality delivery of value in every way; for national development and international cooperation and understanding.  We create new ways of thinking and achievment, making us stand out. Thus, creating both an inspiring place to study and undertake quality research.</p>

  <p> DebugTech is one of Nigeria's great success stories. We have become one of the Nigeria's best private Universities, consistently at the top of the Nigerian Private University League, and we’re steadily making progress to rank among the few best providers of quality science and technology education as well as cutting edge research outputs, at the international front.</p>

   <h4> Debuging University of Technology is a fully residential institution with excellent Academic and Hall of Residence facilities. </h4>


	<h1>	Vision Statement</h1>

<p>To be a world renowned University that is committed to the development and transformation of society through environmental friendly technology and other innovations. </p>
 <p> To discover, disseminate and apply the knowledge of Science and Engineering for human well-being and the development of society.</p>
 
<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<p>	The primary purpose of Debugging University of Technology is to provide quality instruction in Natural and Applied Sciences, Management Sciences, Engineering and Environmental Sciences and other Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes. The Bellstech curriculum strikes a balance between pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and pursuit of practical knowledge needed in the workplace and society in general. Consequently, the academic programmes emphasize a high quality, comprehensive, discipline-based education with intense application of existing and emerging technologies; the ultimate goal being to produce job creators rather than job seekers.</p>


<h1> Our Philosophy</h1>

<p> To promote the advancement of knowledge and produce graduates with well balanced education who are eminent positive contributors to society, and are also capable of self actualization and employment generation.</p>
 

<h1> This Philosophy is guided by the following factors:</h1>
<ul>

<li>   The need to increase access to University education so as to accommodate some of the large population of well qualified candidates that   cannot have places in the existing Universities.</li>
<li>   The need to create an environment conducive to teaching, learning,research and good character building. </li>
<li>  The increasing need to pay attention to the provision of all-round education and training for students. </li>
<li>  The need to nurture the spirit of entrepreneurship in students. </li>
<li>   The emerging economies are now technology-driven. The science-based programmes must enjoy very high priority in the order of things.   But most importantly, there is an urgent need to expose staff as well as students, irrespective of their disciplines, to the tools of Information Communication Technology (ICT) through exposure to computer usage, access to the Internet and the information superhighway.</li>

</ul>

 

<p> Although there are many universities in Nigeria, a lot still need to be done in giving students the type of training that would enable graduates to be self-employed. This is why the curriculum of the Bells University of Technology emphasizes self-reliance and nurturing of entrepreneurial skills necessary for the development of the individual and the nation in general. Thus, with the exception of Management Sciences, all the programmes run by Bellstech are science-based, which are vital to the technological development of the Nation. In addition, there is emphasis on morals and good character formation.</p>

<p>In keeping with the foregoing, DebugTech admits only the best of the available qualified candidates, based on its own criteria. To this end, the University conducts its own admission examination, in addition to JAMB examination, for prospective students. Nonetheless, admission is open to all, irrespective of gender, tribe, race or religion. Special provision is made for handicapped students. This is in keeping with Section 19 of the University Law, which is reproduced in Section 5.12 of the Students' Handbook.</p>


<h1> Our Objectives </h1>

<p>The main objective of the University is to provide an enabling environment for effective learning and teaching, applying the results of research at the cutting-edge of science and technology.Emphasis is placed on areas of training that are suitable for self-employment creation and on those that have relevance to social, cultural, economic, scientific and technological needs of Nigeria.</p>

<h3>The specific academic objectives of DebugTech include: </h3>
<ul>
To provide courses of instruction and other facilities for the acquisition of knowledge in all fields;</li>

<li>To encourage the advancement of learning and to hold out to all persons without distinction of race, religion, creed, gender or political persuasion, the opportunity of acquiring a higher and liberal education;</li>

<li>To provide access to university education in an environmentally friendly setting for some of the numerous qualified candidates who cannot be accommodated in the existing universities;</li>

<li>To act as a centre of academic excellence that will make impact at the cutting-edge of science and technology;</li>

<li>To provide unique courses of instruction and other facilities for acquisition of knowledge in the fields of science and technology;</li>

<li>To provide opportunity for university education that is affordable and sustainable;</li>

<li>To provide a balanced education to all stakeholders;</li>

<li>To promote international cooperation through linkages in pursuit of research, staff and student exchanges. </li>
</ul>
