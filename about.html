<div id="text1">
	<h1 id="heading">	Vision Statement</h1>

<p>To be a world renowned University that is committed to the development and transformation of society through environmental friendly technology and other innovations. </p>
 <p> To discover, disseminate and apply the knowledge of Science and Engineering for human well-being and the development of society.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="text1">
<h1 id="heading">Mission Statement</h1>
<p>	The primary purpose of Debugging University of Technology is to provide quality instruction in Natural and Applied Sciences, Management Sciences, Engineering and Environmental Sciences and other Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes. The Bellstech curriculum strikes a balance between pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and pursuit of practical knowledge needed in the workplace and society in general. Consequently, the academic programmes emphasize a high quality, comprehensive, discipline-based education with intense application of existing and emerging technologies; the ultimate goal being to produce job creators rather than job seekers.</p>
</div>
<div id="text1">
<h1 id="heading"> Our Philosophy</h1>

<p> To promote the advancement of knowledge and produce graduates with well balanced education who are eminent positive contributors to society, and are also capable of self actualization and employment generation.</p>
 </div>
<div id="text1">
<h1 id="heading"> This Philosophy is guided by the following factors:</h1>
<ul>

<li>   The need to increase access to University education so as to accommodate some of the large population of well qualified candidates that   cannot have places in the existing Universities.</li>
<li>   The need to create an environment conducive to teaching, learning,research and good character building. </li>
<li>  The increasing need to pay attention to the provision of all-round education and training for students. </li>
<li>  The need to nurture the spirit of entrepreneurship in students. </li>
<li>   The emerging economies are now technology-driven. The science-based programmes must enjoy very high priority in the order of things.   But most importantly, there is an urgent need to expose staff as well as students, irrespective of their disciplines, to the tools of Information Communication Technology (ICT) through exposure to computer usage, access to the Internet and the information superhighway.</li>

</ul>
</div>
 
<div id="text1">
<p> Although there are many universities in Nigeria, a lot still need to be done in giving students the type of training that would enable graduates to be self-employed. This is why the curriculum of the Bells University of Technology emphasizes self-reliance and nurturing of entrepreneurial skills necessary for the development of the individual and the nation in general. Thus, with the exception of Management Sciences, all the programmes run by Bellstech are science-based, which are vital to the technological development of the Nation. In addition, there is emphasis on morals and good character formation.</p>

<p>In keeping with the foregoing, DebugTech admits only the best of the available qualified candidates, based on its own criteria. To this end, the University conducts its own admission examination, in addition to JAMB examination, for prospective students. Nonetheless, admission is open to all, irrespective of gender, tribe, race or religion. Special provision is made for handicapped students. This is in keeping with Section 19 of the University Law, which is reproduced in Section 5.12 of the Students' Handbook.</p>
